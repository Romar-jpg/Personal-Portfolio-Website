# 👨‍💻 Personal Student Portfolio

A responsive personal portfolio website built for the **GDG (Google Developer Groups) on Campus PUP** Web Development track. This static site introduces my background as a Computer Science student, showcases my recent web development projects, and highlights my personal interests using a modern, Google-themed design.

## ✨ Features

* **Google-Themed Design:** consistently uses the core Google brand colors (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green) for borders, accents, and highlights.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Implements a modern "frosted glass" aesthetic using `backdrop-filter: blur()`, semi-transparent backgrounds, and white borders.
* **Responsive Layout:**
    * Utilizes **CSS Grid** for the project showcase.
    * Utilizes **CSS Flexbox** for the "Top Artists" cards to ensure they sit side-by-side on desktops and stack gracefully on mobile devices.
* **Custom Song Tracklist:** Features a custom CSS implementation of "leader lines" (dotted lines) that dynamically connect song titles to their durations.
* **Interactive Elements:** Smooth hover transformations, shadow effects, and a subtle animated gradient background.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure (Sections, Headers, Footers).
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables (`var(--google-blue)`), and Keyframe animations.
* **Google Fonts:** Typography uses the **Roboto** font family.
* **Tools:** VS Code, Git.
